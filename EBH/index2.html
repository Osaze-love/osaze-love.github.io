          <h2>Our Back Story</h2>
          <p>
            EBH Africa started as community for entrepreneurs to foster
            collaboration and provide a support system for learning and growth
            to both aspiring and already existing entrepreneurs. Soon after the
            community was founded, the global pandemic happened causing a lot of
            businesses to shut down. The community served as a place of support
            to entrepreneurs at the time and it grew overtime due to the massive
            support it was providing not just to Nigerian business owners but
            business owners across other African countries and beyond. Now the
            community has expanded into providing business development services
            to African entrepreneurs through its digital hub.

          <h2>Why Entrepreneurship?</h2>
          <p>
            We strongly believe that entrepreneurship plays a major role in
            economic development. Entrepreneurs represent the demographic with
            the most potential to create jobs, reduce poverty and generate
            revenue in Africa's economy. This is why we are focused on building
            an ecosystem to promote business growth and sustainability in Africa

                etc.

            <h3>Young Entrepreneurship Network</h3>
            <p>
              This initiative is designed specially for undergraduates, recently
              graduated and corp members looking to start or grow their
              entrepreneurial journey. Through this project, young individuals
              will be provided guidance on their business ideas, get the right
              trainings and mentorship to grow a sustainable business.

            <h3>Women Enterprise Program</h3>
            <p>
              This project offers a multidimensional approach to remove the
              constraints women entrepreneurs face in Africa. Women
              entrepreneurs are disproportionately represented in the informal
              economy making them more vulnerable to crisis and less likely to
              access finance to expand their businesses and productivity.

          <div class="recents">
            <h3>Idea To Launch</h3>
            <p>
              A business incubation program for idea and early stage businesses.
              The program will select African entrepreneurs in cohorts and
              provide them with the training, resources and mentorship needed to
              build a sustainable business. At the end of each cohort,
              successful entrepreneurs will pitch their ideas to access funding.
